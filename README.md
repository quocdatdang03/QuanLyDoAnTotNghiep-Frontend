# Graduation Thesis Management System - Frontend (ReactJS)

## 📌 Overview
This is my personal graduation thesis project built with ReactJS for the frontend client side.

It communicates with a **Spring Boot** backend via RESTful APIs and supports multiple user roles including:
- 🧑‍🎓 Students
- 👨‍🏫 Instructors
- 👩‍💼 Department Heads
- 👨‍💻 Academic Staff (Admin)

This project focuses on developing a system to support registration, management, and progress tracking of graduation thesis projects for students, instructors, and academic staff (admin) at the UTE - The University of Da Nang 

## 🔗 Backend Repository
The Backend API powering this Frontend is built with Spring Boot.\
